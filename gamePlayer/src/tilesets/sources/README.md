# Tileset sources

This file explains what the files in this directory are and what relation they
have to the built-in tilesets.

## Tile World

The .blend files are Blender models which used in the Tile World tileset for
tiles which the original tileset does not include.

Renders are made and inserted into the tileset image file manually.

## CGA16

cga16.ase is the Aseprite file which is used to generate the CGA16 image file.
